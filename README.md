# comix
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tizz98/comix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tizz98/comix)

Comix is a raspberry pi based, daily comic calendar. Configurable with many different comic sources.

**Still a work in progress**

## Sources
1. [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/)

## Building

### Go Modules
Make sure you have this environment variable exported. `export GO111MODULE=on`

### Commands

#### Building
1. Locally `make build`, outputs `./comix` binary
1. For raspberry pi `make build-pi`, outputs `./comix-pi` binary

#### Running
note: all commands can use the `--verbose` flag for debug output.

- Download comics and display them: `./comix-pi downloader --source xkcd`
- Version `./comix verion`

### Testing

1. Run redis `docker run -d redis -p 6379`
1. Run tests `REDIS_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:6379 make test`

## Command and Control
Hackers often use this approach when taking control of computers. They create their own CnC server which issues commands to its slaves.
Our program uses a similar approach for handling automatic updates. You can run the CnC server with:

```bash
./comix cnc
```

It will default to port 1337, but you can change it like so:

```bash
./comix cnc --port 4242
```

The following environment variables also must be set:
- `COMIX_REDISADDRESS`
- `COMIX_REDISDBNUMBER`
- `COMIX_UPDATEDISTRIBUTIONURL`

With this running, you can update the command you run on your raspberry pi to (be sure to change ip address!):
```bash
./comix-pi downloader --source xkcd --cnc 127.0.0.1:1337 --client-id 123
```

The CnC service can also be run with docker. 

```bash
COMIX_UPDATEDISTRIBUTIONURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/some-bucket docker-compose up
```
